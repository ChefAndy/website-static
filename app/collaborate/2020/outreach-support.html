                <p>We're hiring an outreach and support coordinator to help us meet the exploding need for library-powered open educational resources and web archiving tools.</p>

            <h2>About the Job</h2>

            <div class="slice-body">

                <p>You'll take the lead in sharing and supporting <a href="https://opencasebook.org">H2O</a>, our platform for open legal textbooks and
                other resources. You'll be the main point of contact for faculty using H2O at Harvard, and you'll be deeply involved in
                our efforts to work with colleagues at other schools and libraries to support widespread use of H2O. You'll also be
                working closely, in an editorial capacity, with a small number of faculty authors preparing print versions of their open
                textbooks.</p>
                
                <p>In addition to your work on H2O, you'll be an important part of the team working to support <a href="https://perma.cc/">Perma.cc</a>, our web archiving
                service, and to adapt it to critical new use cases, such as fact-checking and journalism.</p>
                
                <p>The essence of this job is communicating with people who use the software we build. You'll spend most of your time
                talking, in one form or another, with the people we serve and ensuring that the rest of our team understands their needs
                and interests. You'll use a variety of different communication methods: everything from one-to-one emails to focus group
                discussions to video tutorials to blog and social media posts to conference presentations to updating our online
                documentation.</p>
                
                <p>This work calls for versatility, curiosity, enthusiasm for discovery and learning and a proactive approach to
                problem-solving. You can expect to grow in your strengths and skills in this job and to have the support of our
                close-knit team as we tackle challenges together.</p>
                
                <p>As a member of LIL, you'll also have the opportunity to contribute to other impactful projects and to pursue your own
                research, experiments and explorations, which we call <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/sketches/">sketches</a>. We're proud of our big projects and the impact they
                have, but we also cherish the flexibility and autonomy of being a lab in an academic setting. And we are very serious
                about cultivating a fun, supportive and welcoming work environment.</p>

            <h2>About You</h2>

            <div class="slice-body">
                <p>We're looking for an enthusiastic candidate who's eager to own a major part of the user-facing communication
                responsibility on projects like H2O and Perma. Self-directed professionals who seek input, feedback and discussion yet
                don't require constant supervision thrive in LIL. We value initiative and accountability, and we're looking for someone
                who'll be quick to understand the "plot" of our projects and excited to take responsibility for carrying the story
                forward.</p>
                
                <p>We want a strong, diverse team that reflects different backgrounds, experiences, and identities. Our team members all
                have unique histories, unusual career trajectories and an eclectic array of interests and influences that enhance their
                work. The work and well-being of LIL and the Library are strengthened profoundly by the diversity of our network and our
                differences in background, culture, experience, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and much more. We
                actively seek and welcome applications from people of color, women, the LGBTQIA community, and persons with
                disabilities, as well as applications from across the spectrum of educational and professional backgrounds.</p>
