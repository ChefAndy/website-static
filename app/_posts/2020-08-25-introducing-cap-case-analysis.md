title: Introducing CAP Case Analysis

We’re now sharing case analysis - a new layer of information about cases from the [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/).

Case analysis adds [seven data fields](https://case.law/api/#analysis-fields) you can view in CAP. This update includes fields like PageRank which shows the “all-time” significance of a case based on our [citation graph](https://case.law/download/citation_graph/), or Cardinality that shares the number of unique words in a case. This new layer of data can help us learn new things about cases, like finding the longest court opinion ever published or how language can change in cases over time.

Here’s how it works. You can use case analysis fields by [viewing a case](https://cite.case.law/f-supp/32/817/) in our browser or [using the CAP API](https://api.case.law/v1/cases/4194497/). This way you can learn new things about the cases you’re working with, as individual opinions or groups.

We want to hear about what you’ve learned and created using case analysis. Have something to share? [Send it our way](https://case.law/contact/).
