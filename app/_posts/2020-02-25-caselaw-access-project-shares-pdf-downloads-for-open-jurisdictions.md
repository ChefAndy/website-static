The Caselaw Access Project now has [PDFs downloads available for all open access jurisdictions](https://case.law/download/PDFs/open/) in our collection with selectable text created with OCR.

This development advances access to the law with freely available downloads of volumes digitized from the collections of Harvard Law School Library. These downloads are a view into the story of data made available by the Caselaw Access Project, from 40,000 bound volumes to a machine readable dataset. 

How can I get started? You can begin from our list of [open access jurisdictions](https://case.law/download/PDFs/open/). Letâ€™s start with [Arkansas](https://case.law/download/PDFs/open/Arkansas/). Next, select a reporter and [browse volumes available for download](https://case.law/download/PDFs/open/Arkansas/Ark./). You now have a PDF! ðŸŽ‰

Available downloads are limited to open access jurisdictions including Arkansas, Illinois, New Mexico, and North Carolina. Want to help us drive access to case law? We can do that by advocating courts to make the change to digital-first publishing. [Hereâ€™s how to get started](https://case.law/action/). 

For now, pick your first download and start reading.
