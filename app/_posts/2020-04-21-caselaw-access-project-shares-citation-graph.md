The [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/) is now sharing a citation graph of the 6.7 million cases in our collection from Harvard Law School Library.

This update makes a citation graph available as part of [CAP Downloads](http://case.law/download/citation_graph). Shared as a CSV file, this download uses Case IDs to show cases, and the cases they cite to. Here’s where you can find it: [case.law/download/citation_graph](https://case.law/download/citation_graph/)

Citation graphs show us how cases are connected. The availability of a citation graph lets us find new relationships between cases, like identifying the most influential cases and jurisdictions. We want this update to be a new resource for finding those patterns by researchers and more.

In the future, we want to make new ways to view and access the CAP citation graph by creating a visualization to show the relationships between cases. We’re excited for you to do the same.

We want this update to support the work created by our research community and more. Have something to share? Send it our way! [We’re looking forward to hearing from you](https://case.law/contact/).
