Today we’re announcing [CAP Downloads](https://case.law/download/), a new way to access data from the [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/). 

By sharing segments of data from the Caselaw Access Project as individual datasets, Downloads creates a new resource for researchers and more. The Caselaw Access Project dataset was made possible by the collections and librarians of Harvard Law School Library.  

What data do we have? Let’s go here get started with [case.law/download](https://case.law/download). From here, we can view:

[PDFs](https://case.law/download/PDFs/): Downloads of each volume from open access jurisdictions scanned for the Caselaw Access Project, with selectable text created by OCR as downloadable PDFs.

[Illustrations](https://case.law/download/illustrations/): Thousands of illustrations that appear in U.S. case law. 

[SCDB](https://case.law/download/scdb/): Spreadsheets connecting Supreme Court cases made available by the Caselaw Access Project with metadata from [Supreme Court Database (SCDB)](http://scdb.wustl.edu/), adding a rich new layer of information to cases.

We hope that these datasets will be the breadcrumbs to future research projects, from identifying patterns in judicial decision making, to viewing the illustrations which shape what patent cases look like in U.S. case law.

We like to hear about how people are using data from the Caselaw Access Project. Have something to share? We’re looking forward to [hearing from you](https://case.law/contact/)!
