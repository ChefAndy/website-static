Today weâ€™re announcing CAP Downloads, a new way to access select datasets relating to the [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/). You can CAP Downloads here: (https://case.law/download/)[https://case.law/download/]. 

While researchers can use our (API)[https://api.case.law] and (Bulk Data)[https://case.law/bulk/downolad] tools to access standardardized metadata and text for all of the cases in the CAP dataset, we also want to make it possible to share specialized and derivative datasets. CAP Downloads is our first attempt at this kind of resource.

# How does it work?

Everything available for download is presented in a simple file directory format that lets you navigate to the specific dataset or file you want. Each dataset comes with a README file that includes basic information about the dataset.

# What data do we have?

To view and access what's currently available, visit [case.law/download](https://case.law/download). We're starting with three datasets:
- Scanned images of cases from open access jurisdictions (AR, IL, NC, NM), available as PDFs: (https://case.law/download/PDFs/)[https://case.law/download/PDFs/].
- CSV file mapping connecting metadata from CAP with metadata from the [Supreme Court Database (SCDB)](http://scdb.wustl.edu/):  (https://case.law/download/scdb/)[https://case.law/download/scdb/].
- Images and illustrations found in published case law:(https://case.law/download/illustrations/)[https://case.law/download/illustrations/] 

# What other datasets should we share?

If you have ideas or suggestions for other datasets you'd like us to share, we'd love to hear about it. Contact us at [https://case.law/contact/](https://case.law/contact/)!
