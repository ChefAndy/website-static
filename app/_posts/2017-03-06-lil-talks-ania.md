We were fortunate to have Harvard scholar (and LIL friend) [Ania Aizman](http://complit.fas.harvard.edu/people/anna-aizman) talk to us about Anarchism. She clarified what it was, discussed some of its different branches and how they overlap with familiar groups/events like the Occupy movement.

We discussed “mic checks” and dug into the emergence of anarchism in Russian history. Her absorbing talk took us right to the end of our available time – thanks Ania!
