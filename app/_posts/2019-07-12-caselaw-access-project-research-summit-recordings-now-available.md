Last month we hosted the [Caselaw Access Project Research Summit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V0BQJtC5sNLYdoNYO6qV1b1yRh4NwwJduUqBPwE8Pt4/edit#)! Joined by an international group of researchers to share what we can create with [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/) data, we are excited to [share recordings of those presentations with you](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5bjwZ2MwNlLK4F5a1BKPaDzW1ROU90M7).

Are you using Caselaw Access Project data in your research? Tell us about it at info@case.law.
