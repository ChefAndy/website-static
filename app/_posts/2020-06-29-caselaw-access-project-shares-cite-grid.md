Today we’re sharing [Cite Grid](https://case.law/exhibits/cite-grid), our first visualization of our [citation graph data](https://case.law/download/citation_graph/) showing how states and jurisdictions cite each other.

Citation graphs are a way to see relationships between cases. From “What’s the most cited jurisdiction?” to “What year was the most influential in U.S. case law?”, citation graph data is a place to answer those questions. This visualization is the first time we’re sharing some of those patterns. Here’s how to get started!

You can explore [this visualization](https://case.law/exhibits/cite-grid) two ways. The map view allows you to select a jurisdiction, and view inbound and outbound citations. This shows states more likely to cite that jurisdiction in a darker color. For example, when viewing “Texas”, the states Missouri and California are shown as most likely to cite that state.

The grid view allows you to view the percentage of citations by and to each state. Here’s an example! When we select one square, we can see that 1.4% of cases from Colorado cite California. That’s just one kernel of citation data for you to find.

This visualization was created with our [citation graph data](https://case.law/download/citation_graph/). Do you want to create your own visualization with the data supporting this tool? We’re sharing the dataset [here](https://case.law/download/citation_graph/2020-05-08/aggregations/).

Have you created applications, research, and more with our citation graph data? We want to [hear about it](https://case.law/contact/), and help you spread the word!
