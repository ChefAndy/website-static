title: Caselaw Access Project Shares Data Release and Bulk Metadata
author: kelly-fitzpatrick

Today we’re sharing a new data release.

This update makes bulk downloads of case metadata available by [jurisdiction](https://case.law/download/bulk_exports/20200604/by_jurisdiction/case_metadata/) and [reporter](https://case.law/download/bulk_exports/20200604/by_reporter/case_metadata/). This release also includes the “cites_to” field in bulk downloads which shows which cases an opinion cites to, refines case citations, and removes duplicate volumes. 

This release is made available as part of [CAP Downloads](https://case.law/download/), which shares specialized datasets from our collection. 

We’re looking forward to seeing how you use this data in research, projects, and more. Have something to share? We’re excited to [hear about it](https://case.law/contact/).
