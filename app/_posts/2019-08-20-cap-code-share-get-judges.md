This month we're sharing new ways to start working with data from the [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/). This CAP code share from Anastasia Aizman shows us how to find judges from cases with the [CAP API](https://case.law/api/) and [CourtListener](https://www.courtlistener.com/): [Get judges](https://github.com/harvard-lil/cap-examples/blob/master/get_judges/get_judges.ipynb)! 

Judicial activity shapes the millions of court opinions that make up our legal history. With data, we can learn new things about the activity of individual judges, and how that activity influences that larger landscape. This code share reviews how to get started with the names of judges. 

This code finds judges from cases using the [CAP API](https://case.law/api/) and [CourtListener](https://www.courtlistener.com/). By forming a query to the CAP API and returning the cases from that query, this code connects keywords that match with individual judges using the [CourtListener API](https://www.courtlistener.com/api/). The final output creates a data frame of those judges and related data in CourtListener. Nice ðŸ™Œ
