title: LIL Takes Toronto: the Creative Commons Summit 2018

The Creative Commons Conference in Toronto was this past weekend wonderful! It was a pleasure to meet the mix of artists, educators, civil servants, policymakers, journalists, and copyright agents (and more) who were there.

Talks touched on everything from how the Toronto Public Library manages their digital collections and engages their local cultural and tech communities with collections, to feminist theory and open access, to the state of copyright/open access worldwide. 

The range of stakeholders and interested parties involved with open access was more than I realized. While Iâ€™m familiar with libraries and academics being interested in OA and OER, but the number of government policymakers and artists who were there to learn and discuss was heartening.

Until next year, Creative Commons! And thank you, Ontario!
